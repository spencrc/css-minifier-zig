# css-minifier-zig
The majority of this project was written in one sitting at Carleton University in Ottawa. I hope to finish it eventually, but it's on the back burner right now!

Currently may not properly support URLs, functions, or variables.

## Todo
- Create test suite
- Ensure project parses according to CSS spec (not all tokens are properly supported yet)
- Clean up code
